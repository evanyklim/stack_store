		description: 'While the original Air Jordan came out in a multitude of colors, some of which still may be undocumented except in old copies of BOON. But the Air Jordan 1 Low was much simpler. You could get it in any color you wanted as long as that color was either white/natural or white/metallic blue. For some reason the current Air Jordan 1 Low is cut entirely differently, so the only way to find a "real" Air Jordan 1 Low is to track down a pair from 1985' ,
